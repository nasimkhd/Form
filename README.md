# Form

This is my project. This is a table which can get person's name and family name. Add these information in the table. We have two conditions, we can edit and delete our rows. By clicking delete our row would be deleted and by pressing delete the iformation get back to our text and the add button change to Modify, so after editing our name we can press Modify and edit our table.
Also, for users's convinient we have checkboxex beside our table, we can select all or some of our table's rows. Then we can delete bunch of our names by chechking more than one checkboxes and we have delete button which do this for us.
All these are done by JavaScript and using DOM and events.
